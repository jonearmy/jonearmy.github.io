                                      <h4>Co-Discovery for a Startup Founder</h4>
                                      <h5 class="type--uppercase">Coordination & Execution</h5>
                                        <p>My first exposure to the discovery phase, and more specifically co-discovery sessions, was actively organizing and planning the agenda with the Focus21 design team. Throughout this planning process, we determined what information must be gathered, from which stakeholders, and through what methods. The design lead, <a href="http://fjadczak.ca/">Filip Jadczak</a>, had previously led these sessions, and we began to assemble a list of activities from a variety of resources such as <a href="https://gamestorming.com/">Gamestorming</a> and the <a href="https://www.jeffgothelf.com/lean-ux-book/">Lean UX Book</a>. Some of the activities we selected to run during my first experience were Proto Personas, User Journey Mapping and the Feature Hypothesis Chart. These provided a foundation for our final deliverables such as the personas, an information architecture, workflow diagrams and wireframes. </p>
                                        <p>At the end of the session, we clearly defined to the client what to expect as outcomes and deliverables. This particular client was an entrepreneur with a new startup idea seeking potential investors and business partners. We provided wireframes and working prototypes of the various user interfaces required for the idea. The founder of the startup found these extremely valuable when communicating the concept to get investor buy-in. </p>
                                        <p>In past co-discovery engagements, Focus21 would provide the deliverables often accompanied by little written content. We identified that the co-discovery activity diagrams were not a sufficient deliverable without proper context. I took the initiative to create a Focus21 branded template to reuse for future co-discovery sessions to aid in the transfer of information. Our talented UX intern, Krisika Suthan created most of the diagrams for this client and used my template to document the context around them. The design team then reconstructed the activity outcomes in the form of visual diagrams accompanied by this written report. </p>
                                        <p>We learned from this experience that the supporting documentation and report was helpful to both the client and Focus21. The client is able to reflect on the activities we conducted for use throughout the evolution of her concept and product idea. Since this client session, a combined report with visual diagrams has been a standard deliverable for Focus21 co-discovery. </p>

                                      <h5 class="type--uppercase">Leading &amp; Delivering</h5>
                                      <p>One of the most rewarding co-discovery sessions was for client with over 700 employees and users across Canada who rely on their website on a daily basis. I had the opportunity to co-lead a co-discovery session at the client’s offices in Toronto with stakeholders who had flown in from offices around Canada.</p>
                                      <p>We dove deep into the client’s stated problem at the session, learning from stakeholder perspectives at all levels of the organization. Some of the activities we selected for this particular session were the <a href="https://gamestorming.com/start-stop-continue/">Start, Stop, Continue</a>, <a href="https://gamestorming.com/prune-the-future/">Prune the Future</a>, the <a href="https://gamestorming.com/stakeholder-analysis/">Stakeholder Analysis</a>, <a href="https://gamestorming.com/flip-it/">Flip It</a>, and the <a href="https://gamestorming.com/history-map/">History Map</a>.</p>
                                      <p>After this two-day session completed, we began our process of creating diagrams and reports for each activity to help guide future decision making. I completed roughly half of the visual diagrams along with another designer, <a href="https://leeseul.com/">Seul lee</a>, and wrote a large portion of the accompanying report for the final deliverables. </p>

                                      <h5 class="type--uppercase">Learning &amp; Leading</h5>
                                      <p>In addition to external client-facing co-discovery sessions, Focus21 ran internal co-discovery sessions for internal projects. During my time at Focus21, I was able to participate in these sessions for the redesign and redevelopment of the <a href=”https://focus21.io”>Focus21.io</a> website, the development of a new area of business, the <a href=”https://uxlab.focus21.io/”>Focus21 UX Lab</a>, and <a href=”https://mt.focus21.io/lets-talk”>Focus21 marketing</a> initiatives. </p>
                                      <p>For the Focus21 website and marketing initiatives, Filip and I developed the agenda and facilitated the internal session. We completed proto personas to refocus on who the decision makers are when it comes to finding a custom software partner. I completed the digital conversion of the paper proto-personas to sketch diagrams which can be seen below. </p>
                                      <p>We then handed the proto personas off to our marketing partner, Traffic Soda, who was able to refer to these when developing ad campaigns across LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
